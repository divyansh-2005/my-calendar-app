- **Notes Management:** Store and organize notes with timestamps.
- **Responsive Design:** Works across desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend

- **React.js:** JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router:** Declarative routing for React applications.
- **Axios:** Promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js.
- **CSS Modules:** Scoped CSS for modular and reusable styling.
- **Material-UI:** React components for faster and easier web development.
- **Context API:** For state management across the application.

### Backend

- **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
- **Express:** Web framework for building RESTful APIs.
- **MongoDB:** NoSQL database for storing user data, expenses, todos, and notes.
- **Mongoose:** ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** For secure user authentication.
- **Bcrypt.js:** For password hashing.

### Deployment

- **Frontend:** Deployed on Vercel.
- **Backend:** Deployed on Heroku.
- **Database:** Hosted on MongoDB Atlas.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Frontend:**
  - Node.js (v14 or higher)
  - npm or yarn
  - react and vite

- **Backend:**
  - Node.js (v14 or higher)
  - MongoDB (Atlas or local)
  - Postman or any API client for testing

### Installation

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/divyansh-2005/my-calendar-app.git
cd my-calendar-app
```

#### 2. Setting up the Backend

1. Navigate to the backend directory:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the backend and add the following environment variables:

   ```plaintext
   MONGO_URI=your_mongo_db_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   PORT=5000
   ```

4. Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The server will run on `http://localhost:5000`.

#### 3. Setting up the Frontend

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the frontend development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The frontend will run on `http://localhost:3000`.

## API Endpoints

Refer to the [Backend Documentation](backend/README.md) for detailed information on available API endpoints.

## Testing

### Backend

Use Postman or any other API client to test backend endpoints. Set the headers to include `x-auth-token` for authenticated requests.

### Frontend

Ensure that the backend server is running. Use your browser to access the frontend on `http://localhost:3000` and interact with the application.

## Deployment

### Backend

1. Push the backend code to your Heroku repository.
2. Set the environment variables on Heroku using the `.env` file.

### Frontend

1. Deploy the frontend on Vercel by linking your repository.
2. Ensure the frontend is configured to communicate with the deployed backend.
